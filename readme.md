# MCSR Legal Mods

This repository acts as a central authority for legal mods for the Minecraft Java Edition Speedrunning community. This means runs can be done using the mods found in this repository and be submitted and verified on https://speedrun.com/mc.
(Pending moderator approval for being official)

## What mods are legal for what Minecraft versions?

Each mod has its own directory, and in that directory are more directories named after the legal Minecraft version ranges. For example, Sodium for 1.16.5 can be found in `legal-mods/sodium/1.16.2-1.16.5/`.

Sometimes there will be missing Minecraft versions for a mod. If you really need a mod for a specific Minecraft version that isn't available in this repository, please read the following:
> If there is no listed jar for a specific MC subversion, a jar from within the same major MC version can be used if it functions correctly.
> For example, if Lithium for MC 1.15.2 works for MC 1.15.1, it may be used for MC 1.15.1, but Lithium for MC 1.16.5 may not be used for MC 1.17 since it falls under a different major version (1.16 vs 1.17).

## Internal Mod Files

Most mods included in this repository are mods made by the community, these mods are included in this repository as .jar files. For example: `legal-mods/sodium/1.16.2-1.16.5/sodium-1.16.5-v1.jar`.
